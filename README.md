#### ðŸ”” <a href="https://github.com/XIJIAYU/weather-search-system"> Weather Search System </a>
- Used Flask as the back-end framework, and built the back end based on Python
- Deployed the project in the cloud on Google Cloud App Engine
- Used Google API and Tomorrow.io API to get the weather information, and used HighCharts Service to draw charts
- Used JSON as a data format to exchange data between front-end and back-end
***
#### ðŸ”” Mathematical Modeling Competition: Research on the Influence of Global Feb. 2020 Warming on Fish Migration and Fishing Company
- Adopted Cubic Spline Interpolation to get the continuous variation values of sea surface temperatures
- Simulated the fish migration along with the variation of sea surface temperature in the next 50 years based on the Monte Carlo model with artificial fish swarms algorithm (AFSA)
- Built mixed-non linear programming model and solved the model with Lingo; pinned down the improvement proposals of fishing company considering their investment costs, net profits, timeliness and stability so as to get minimal costs and maximum profits
***
#### ðŸ”” Visualization of Ecological Environment Evolution based on GIS
- Mastered the use of Supermap; drew Thematic map with SuperMap iDesktop which was published on the iServer; conducted secondary development based on iClient
- Built the web page based on Flask and Bootstrap; displayed the map data with Echarts to present a vivid and interactive data visualization chart
- Realized the mapâ€™s functions including distance and area measurement, path analysis and Query
